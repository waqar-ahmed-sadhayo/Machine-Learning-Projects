# 🩺 Disease Detector - Heart Disease Prediction

The **Disease Detector** is a Machine Learning project designed to predict the likelihood of **heart disease** based on patient health data.  
It uses classification techniques to analyze medical attributes and provide predictions that can support healthcare diagnostics.

This project is built in **Python (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab)** and leverages powerful ML libraries for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🔹 Data preprocessing & cleaning for health datasets  
- 🔹 Train ML models (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)  
- 🔹 Evaluate models using accuracy & classification reports  
- 🔹 Save & load trained models with Joblib  
- 🔹 Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step execution
